Coaching encompasses various styles, each with its own approach. Some examples include:

1. **Transformational Coaching:** Focuses on personal and professional development, aiming for profound and lasting change.
2. **Confronting Coaching:** Involves challenging individuals to confront and address their limiting beliefs or behaviors.
3. **Ontological Coaching:** Emphasizes shifts in being, language, and emotions to create change in behavior and results.
4. **Solution-Focused Coaching:** Concentrates on identifying and implementing solutions rather than dwelling on problems.
5. **GROW Model:** Goal, Reality, Options, Wrap-up; a structured approach to goal setting and problem-solving.
6. **Narrative Coaching:** Explores and reshapes personal narratives to promote growth and change.
7. **Positive Psychology Coaching:** Integrates principles of positive psychology to enhance well-being and strengths.
8. **Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) Coaching:** Utilizes language and behavior patterns to help individuals achieve specific goals.
9. **Team Coaching:** Focuses on enhancing the performance and dynamics of a team rather than individual development.
10. **Mindfulness Coaching:** Incorporates mindfulness practices to promote self-awareness and stress reduction.
    of course these overlap and the coach decides which style works the best for the coachee and situation.. also these are not "type" of coaching.. they are different like life coaching, leadership coaching, health and wellness coaching, etc.
