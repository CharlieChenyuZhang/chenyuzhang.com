## Acknowledgements

As part of EDU T566: Learning Design for All at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, I developed this independent project to rethink how we evaluate people and to re-humanize learners—moving away from treating them as mere datapoints in a system. I’m incredibly grateful to Dr. Amin Marei, our course instructor, and Mrinmoy Saha, the teaching fellow, for their invaluable feedback, thoughtful guidance, and constant encouragement throughout this process. Their insights played a huge role in helping me shape and refine this work. I truly appreciate the supportive and inspiring environment they created—one that pushes us to think creatively and design with purpose.
