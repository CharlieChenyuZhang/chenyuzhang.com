## Future Work

This project is still a **theoretical proposal**, so the next steps are all about turning the idea into something practical and seeing how well it works in real-world settings. The first step will be to build a web app prototype that brings the GRADE framework to life. This prototype will serve as a starting point to test the system’s functionality and gather initial feedback from educators and students.

Once the prototype is ready, the next phase will involve testing it in actual classroom settings. By observing how teachers and students interact with the tool, we can better understand what works, what doesn’t, and where we need to improve. This step is crucial for refining the system and making it more user-friendly and effective.

To truly measure the impact of this approach, we’ll need to conduct experiments and **randomized controlled trials (RCTs)**. These studies will help us determine whether the GRADE framework improves outcomes like student engagement, learning retention, and fairness in assessment compared to traditional methods. Collecting both qualitative and quantitative data will give us a clearer picture of its real-world value.

Finally, the feedback and insights gained from these steps will guide us in improving and iterating on the framework. This process will allow us to fine-tune the tool, making it adaptable and scalable for different learning environments. By moving from theory to practice, we hope to create a solution that reimagines educational assessment and delivers meaningful benefits for both students and educators.

## Acknowledgements

As part of EDU T566: Learning Design for All at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, I developed this independent project to rethink how we evaluate people and to re-humanize learners—moving away from treating them as mere datapoints in a system. I’m incredibly grateful to Dr. Amin Marei, our course instructor, and Mrinmoy Saha, the teaching fellow, for their invaluable feedback, thoughtful guidance, and constant encouragement throughout this process. Their insights played a huge role in helping me shape and refine this work. I truly appreciate the supportive and inspiring environment they created—one that pushes us to think creatively and design with purpose.
