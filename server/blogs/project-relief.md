## Contributions

I took on several responsibilities, both technical and administrative:

- **Human Subjects Review (COUHES/IRB) Lead:**

  - Led the MIT COUHES form completion process, attending weekly office hours, troubleshooting independently, and securing final approval.
  - Liaised effectively with the Harvard IRB, consolidating multiple cases into a single streamlined request, and coordinating with Harvard collaborators.

- **Experimental Design & Content Creation:**

  - Designed all 30 programming questions targeting Big-O notation complexity, finalizing the experimental structure to ensure comprehensive data collection.
  - Built a fully functional full-stack web application from scratch (React.js, Express.js, AWS Amplify and App Runner, DynamoDB), implementing 7 event-tracking features, 8 RESTful APIs, and 6 custom React components for an enhanced participant experience and robust data capture.

- **Participant Recruitment & Management:**

  - Recruited 22 participants through professional networks (WeChat groups, LinkedIn), and individually managed communications by sending personalized emails and creating 35 unique Zoom links for sessions.

- **Data Analysis & Reporting:**

  - Contributed to post-research data analysis, synthesizing insights to refine our understanding of frustration and smiling behaviors in online learning.
  - Authored key sections of the final report, including:
    - Abstract
    - Introduction
    - Research Questions
    - Study Design
    - Partial contributions to Related Work (Focus on Function in Learning, Contextual and Cultural Aspects of Frustration)
    - Partial contributions to the Limitations section
    - Acknowledgements
    - Appendix (featuring screenshots, questions, and study materials)

  Additionally, I reviewed and edited all remaining sections of the report, ensuring coherence and clarity throughout.

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed as part of the course MAS.630: Advanced Seminar on Affective Computing and Ethics at the MIT Media Lab. I am especially grateful to our teammates, Yilin Qi and Anku Rani, for their exceptional collaboration and contributions throughout this project. We are deeply grateful to Professor Rosalind Picard for her invaluable guidance, thought-provoking discussions, and support throughout the course. Her expertise in affective computing has been an inspiration to this work. We would also like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the teaching assistants, Xiajie Zhang, Jocelyn Scheirer, and Manuel Cherep, for their insightful feedback, thoughtful critiques, and dedicated assistance during the study. Their contributions greatly enriched our understanding and helped refine this research. Lastly, we thank Marcella Framondi for her administrative support and for ensuring a smooth learning experience.
