## Public Narrative

I had a knife under my pillow.

For three years, I slept with a knife under my pillow because I was scared—afraid someone would attack me. That knife made me feel safe.

But I wasn’t always like this. I used to be a carefree, muddy little boy, without a worry in the world. In high school, things changed. One day, while I was at my desk working on problems, a class bully came up behind me. He was six feet tall, towering over me. I noticed him standing there, but I forced myself to ignore him. He bent down, and I could feel his breath on my neck. I tried to stay focused, tried to block him out. But suddenly, he put his hand on my neck and whispered in my ear, "What are you working on?"

I was irritated and told him to go away.

Then, I heard a loud thud. Something hit my head hard. My glasses flew off. I was stunned, not fully understanding what had happened. I stood up, turned around to pick up my glasses, but before I could, a fist slammed into my left eye. I saw stars. My eye swelled up so much that I couldn’t see the blackboard. An hour later, I started having a nosebleed. When I got to the hospital, the doctor told me I had a fractured orbital bone around my left eye. I was told I had to stay in bed for six months to prevent cerebrospinal fluid leakage, which could affect my intelligence. If it worsened, I might lose symmetry in my eyes or, even worse, lose my vision.

For six months, I couldn’t move. I had to eat, drink, and relieve myself in bed. My mother, bless her heart, quit her job to care for me. She stayed by my side every single day. In that time, I realized that maybe only a mother would do something like this for her child. I felt like I owed her everything.

The boy who hit me? He was never punished because his father was the police chief. In fact, the teacher who witnessed the incident received an "Outstanding Teacher" award shortly after. At that time, I thought the world was just that dark.

My parents, under immense pressure, pursued legal action. But that experience taught me something important: when faced with injustice, you have to stand up, even if the other side has power and influence.

Things are settled but the heart is slow to heal. After that, I had a knife under my pillow.

For years, I completely shut off my heart. I didn’t share my feelings with anyone. It took me 10 years to fully recover from that experience. But then, I took this Public Narrative class, and I began to see hope again. We might speak different languages, come from different cultures, have different hardships, and tell different stories—but in this room, we care about each other. We support each other. This class made me wonder: maybe there is still hope after all. Maybe, for people like me who have experienced something similar, it doesn’t have to take 10 years to heal.

To everyone in this room—Danni, Anjali, Diego, Jane, Jessica, Julia, Matias, Nevia, Sara, Svitlana—you all gave me the courage to share my story. Just to name a few, Diego, your story of being in prison and fighting for immigrant rights, and Julia, your story of facing sexual harassment, were both powerful. I would never expect these stories to be shared in a class setting, but they were incredibly encouraging and motivating. If each of you is brave enough to show your true self, then I should do the same.

There are 2.4 billion children under the age of 18 in the world, and 19% of students report being bullied at school. That’s 456 million children. 456 million children who might need 10 years—or maybe their entire lives—to heal from those experiences.

That’s when it hit me—my Aha moment. With my background in software engineering, maybe I can do something about it. I want to build an online, anonymous community where people can share their stories, their public narratives, and help each other heal.

So, here’s my ask. On the screen is a QR code. If you’re interested, please take a photo, and spend three minutes to complete a short, six-question survey by the end of today.

I had a knife under my pillow. But with your support, I no longer need that knife. And maybe, with each other’s help, millions or even billions of people won’t need the knife under their pillow either.
