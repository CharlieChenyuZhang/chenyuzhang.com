## Abstract

This is the story of how a traumatic experience in my youth shaped my life and ultimately inspired me to create a solution that brings people together to heal, share, and support one another.

## Overview

I was once a carefree child, enjoying the simplicity of life in a small village in China. But an incident in high school left me scarred, both physically and emotionally. It took me a decade to begin to heal. Through a Public Narrative class, I found hope and courage, and now, I aim to help others who’ve faced similar challenges.

## My Story

### Childhood

I grew up in a small village called Weifang. As a kid, I loved lying on the grass, feeling the warmth of the sun, and letting ants crawl over me without a care in the world. I was alone, but I never felt lonely.

### High School

In high school, life changed. I was a "nerd," consumed by problem sets and the looming Chinese college entrance exam. One day, a bully in my class, six feet tall, loomed over me as I worked at my desk. He whispered in my ear, "What are you working on?" When I told him to go away, he hit me.

My glasses flew off, and his fist struck my left eye, leaving me with a fractured orbital bone. I spent six months bedridden, cared for by my mother, who quit her job to stay by my side.

The bully faced no consequences because his father was the police chief. The teacher who witnessed it all even received an "Outstanding Teacher" award.

### The Knife Under My Pillow

After that, I slept with a knife under my pillow for three years, afraid someone might attack me again.

### Healing

It took me 10 years to start healing. When I took Professor Marshall Ganz’s Public Narrative class at Harvard, I was inspired by classmates who shared their stories of resilience. I realized that our shared vulnerability could be a source of strength and healing.

## Motivation

There are 2.4 billion children under 18 in the world, and 19% report being bullied—that’s 456 million children. Many might take years to recover from their experiences, or worse, carry the trauma forever.

## A Vision for Change

With my background in software engineering, I want to build an online, anonymous community where people can share their public narratives and support each other.

## Call to Action

If you believe in this vision, please scan the QR code on the screen and spend three minutes answering a short survey. Together, we can create a world where no one needs a knife under their pillow.

## Acknowledgements

To everyone in my Public Narrative class: thank you for giving me the courage to share my story.
