I want to share a feeling that's been with me for a while and its getting stronger and stronger. I feel constently that my heart is pounding and a constant feeling that I am not doing enough. The dis-satisfaction with life in general and career.

Yesterday, I attended a class at MIT Media Lab MIT MAS .S61 - What is a Better Future?

In this class, the question is what's a better future that's worth living?

Stanford D-School has used Design Thinking to help people to figure out how to live a better life by first divering and then converging.

There's a metaphor. I am like the monkey hording lots of chips and hand is stuck in a bottle and I can't take my hand out. The harder I tried, the more painful it is and the monkey is not willing to let go. I feel like I am this monkey. I am doing many projects and want to sign up for everything.
