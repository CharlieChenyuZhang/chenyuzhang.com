## Thoughts on UDL

After learning about the development of UDL, I really appreciate its iterative and expanding nature. UDL was initially created in a hospital setting to support students with disabilities that hindered their learning in traditional schools. Over time, its mission broadened to reducing barriers in traditional education, eventually moving beyond the hospital setting altogether.

I find the UDL framework particularly compelling because it focuses on fostering _expert learners_ [[1]](/blog/udl-reflection.md#reference-rose-2013) rather than simply having students memorize basic facts through rote learning. UDL-based learning goals emphasize both _learning_ and _doing_. However, in my experience, teachers are often too busy to thoughtfully design these authentic learning goals and tailor them to individual students—especially in the U.S., where classrooms are highly diverse, not just in learning needs but also in cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. This highlights a limitation of the UDL framework: it primarily addresses _ability_ but does not explicitly consider _identity_.

This raises an important question: Should it ultimately be the student's responsibility to make sense of the course content and develop the agency to understand _why_ they are learning it? Perhaps students shouldn’t be forced to study subjects if they don’t see their relevance.

One aspect of UDL I particularly admire is its commitment to continual improvement. I am especially interested in how learning technologies—particularly adaptive learning systems—can not only _teach_ but also _learn_ about each student’s unique strengths and weaknesses, then dynamically adjust to optimize their learning path. With this approach, the curriculum evolves in real-time, analyzing what works and what doesn’t for each student, and offering alternatives, as UDL suggests. Beyond individualization, the curriculum should also adapt to its broader cultural context—incorporating different values, knowledge, and skill sets. In essence, the curriculum itself should _both teach and learn_. This concept was also highlighted by David Rose in the Week 2 mini-lecture and discussed in a well-researched UDL paper [[2]](/blog/udl-reflection.md#reference-Rao-2023).

The UDL framework is grounded in three key brain networks [[3]](/blog/udl-reflection.md#reference-meyer-2014):

- **The affective network** – responsible for emotional processing and engagement.
- **The recognition network** – responsible for perception and pattern recognition.
- **The strategic network** – responsible for planning, motor skills, and executive functioning.

Ancient Chinese wisdom aligns closely with these ideas. Confucius once said _"有教无类"_ (_yǒu jiào wú lèi_), which translates to _"education for all, without discrimination."_ This is conceptually similar to the idea of equity in the Western world—the belief that everyone has a right to education. As an educator, I strongly believe that _there are no bad students—only ineffective teaching methods_. Confucius also advocated _"因材施教"_ (_yīn cái shī jiào_), meaning _"teaching according to individual abilities and needs."_ Remarkably, these ideas were established over 2,500 years ago.

One of my favorite discussions on this topic is Todd Rose’s TEDx Talk, _"The Myth of Average: Todd Rose at TEDxSonomaCounty."_ In this talk, Prof. Rose argues for the need to _“ban the average”_ and instead design for _the edges_—creating learning experiences that accommodate the widest possible range of students. This principle is at the heart of UDL, which rejects the outdated concept of an _“average learner.”_ However, a few key questions remain:

- How can this be achieved in a _cost-effective_ manner?
- How far should the design for the _edges_ extend? What defines a _reasonable range_ of inclusivity?

I also found this to be a useful handout on implementing UDL, developed by CAST (formerly known as the Center for Applied Special Technology):

Now, shifting our focus to the human brain: One fascinating concept I learned this week is the classification of species into _altricial_ and _precocial_ groups. Humans are an _altricial species_, meaning that when we are born, our brains are not fully developed—it takes us years to acquire basic skills like walking. In contrast, _precocial species_ (such as horses) can walk within hours of birth.

Another interesting concept is _neuronal migration_—the process by which neurons are formed and travel to the cortex (the outer layer of the brain). Initially, all neurons look identical as they migrate, but they _differentiate_ into specific types only once they reach their final destination.

## Reflection on UDL - Affective Networks: "Why of Learning"

Affect is related to people's feelings. Affective networks enable us to engage with tasks and influence our motivation to learn, setting up priorities and preferences. Affective states, such as stress and confidence, impact our ability to learn.

> While emotion and cognition can be somewhat separable, they’re rarely in opposition. Instead, they are intertwined in a collaborative relationship needed for normal function. As tasks with both emotive and cognitive components become more difficult (e.g., making an increasingly complex economic decision in a setting that is increasingly unfair), activity in the two structures becomes more synchronized.

> — Sapolsky, 2018, Kindle location: 1,011

From my own experience, when I am under stress, my cognitive ability tends to decrease, making it difficult to think. I can think better when I am calm. Not too long ago, I had an interview at my dream company, where the interviewer asked me to solve a coding question. I provided an answer, but the interviewer was not satisfied and asked me to come up with an alternative solution. At that moment, my mind went blank—I panicked. I felt my brain overheating, and I couldn't think of anything. As a result, I did not pass the interview.

Cognitive appraisal (or the Biopsychosocial Model of Challenge and Threat) can influence how we respond and perform in particular situations, both consciously and unconsciously.

![Biopsychosocial Model of Challenge and Threat](https://chenyuzhang-com-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/EDU-T560-UDL/The-Biopsychosocial-Model-of-Challenge-and-Threat-and-Implications-for-Creativity.png)
(Source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Biopsychosocial-Model-of-Challenge-and-Threat-and-Implications-for-Creativity_fig1_327947564))

This leads to the discussion of Growth Mindset versus Fixed Mindset.

A key consideration is how feedback can be provided in a way that does not trigger a threat response but instead fosters a growth mindset.

![Wise Critical Feedback](https://chenyuzhang-com-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/EDU-T560-UDL/Screenshot+2025-02-14+at+10.40.22%E2%80%AFPM.png)
(Source: [APA](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xge-a0033906.pdf))

A notable insight from this paper is that the combination of **criticism, high standards, and assurance** is the secret ingredient to improving students' performance. This makes me wonder if an AI tutor could incorporate a similar approach to enhance students' learning outcomes.

There are a few pending questions.

- What does self-regulation entails and what strategies people use to develp it?
- How can AI be used to promote self-regulation?

## Reflection on UDL - The Recognition Network

![image](https://chenyuzhang-com-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/EDU-T560-UDL/recognition+is+specialized.png)
_(Source: 2008 Pearson Education, Inc.)_

The recognition network is located in the back of the brain. I found this article [[4]](/blog/udl-reflection.md#meditation24-7) interesting, where it talked about Aristotle (384-322 BC), who is credited with first numbering the senses in his work _De Anima_. Those senses are sight (vision), hearing (audition), smell (olfaction), taste (gustation), and touch (tactition). Because there is some overlap between different senses, different methods of neurological classification can yield as many as 21 senses. Eco-psychologist Michael J. Cohen puts the number of senses at our disposal at 53.

If we look at UDL horizontally, it is all about multi-modality.

- **Row 1: Access** - Providing multiple ways for students to access and interact with the content.
- **Row 2: Support** - Establishing connections, working with others, getting feedback, and responding in multiple ways.
- **Row 3: Executive Function** - Understanding what makes sense to us as individuals, how we connect it to other things we know, and how we set goals.

Besides this, today I also learned that alt tags for images are used by screen readers. As a software engineer, I know I need to add alt text, but I think it serves two purposes.

1. The alt text is displayed when the image link is broken and the image cannot be displayed.
2. Screen readers primarily read the alt text of the image to visually impaired users.

One misconception I had before was that screen readers relied on the `aria-label`, but after looking it up, I found that screen readers mainly use the `alt` text for images. In class, the instructor showed that _The New York Times_ and many other websites actually didn’t add alt text for images as of February 28, 2025, when I wrote this reflection.

My personal opinion is that ideally, all images should have alt text. However, some images on news websites do not carry any informational value and are meant purely for visual aesthetics. In such cases, there may be no need to add alt text, as the primary and secondary headlines on the news already convey enough information. But in an ideal scenario, all images should have alt text.

I also realized that many of the images on my personal website do not have alt text. Maybe I should start adding them going forward. What’s the point of learning UDL if my own website is not very user-friendly?

### The Myth of Learning Styles and Brain Plasticity

One surprising thing I learned this week is the so-called **myth of learning styles**. The concept of learning styles has been around for a few decades and is deceptively attractive—people like to believe they are visual learners or auditory learners. However, **people don’t actually learn that way!** This is an oversimplification of how our brains truly function.

**Recognition is variable.** Allison Posey mentioned **brain plasticity** and the concept of _live wiring_ or _live-wired_ from David Eagleman. The brain is an enormous system designed to extract patterns and meaning from those patterns. Connections are constantly forming—some fast, some slow, some strong, some weak—all happening simultaneously.

This reminds me of a paper by Xander Davies [[5]](/blog/udl-reflection.md#grokking-and-double-descent) discussing **Grokking and Double Descent**, as well as the interplay of slow and fast learning patterns. It’s fascinating to consider the balance between _live wiring_—the brain’s ongoing adaptability—and _hardwired_ connections that allow for rapid access to information.

### The Brain as a Prediction Machine

One of the most interesting insights is that our brains **are not passive recipients of information**. Instead, we are constantly and persistently **anticipating and predicting** what we will see and hear.

This realization could be a key innovation in **AI-driven tutoring systems**—if we can design AI models that anticipate and predict patterns like the human brain, we may be able to create more adaptive and effective learning experiences. Our **expectations** actively shape our perception, which has profound implications for AI tutors, multi-agent collaboration, and reinforcement learning models.

### Heterarchy vs. Hierarchy

- In a **heterarchy**, all nodes function in parallel, with no predefined importance.
- In a **hierarchy**, some nodes are prioritized over others.

Understanding the **balance between top-down and bottom-up processes** is crucial. A well-functioning **recognition network** takes advantage of both approaches. Teaching that relies solely on either top-down or bottom-up instruction **does not align with how our brains learn**.

### The Hidden Layers of Reading

Another key insight I gained is the **hidden layer of reading**—for example, when we see the word **MAT**, our brain does far more than just recognize the letters. We instinctively interpret meaning, context, and associations, all in a fraction of a second.

These insights are incredibly valuable as my brain makes connections between **how human cognition works and how machine learning models**—or **multi-agent collaboration systems**—could be designed in the future.

## David Rose's Guest Lecture – Reflections on Bias, UDL, and the Future of Education

> I’m 79 years old. Have I made all the right choices? Has this been a good life? An unexpected advantage of living in a Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC) is that dinner feels like a date night—but without the pressure of romance. It’s just genuine conversation. No worries about grants or careers. People talk about turning points in their lives, the most exciting moments, and what really mattered.
> — David Rose

During this session, we also learned that Jenna Gravel and Nicole Tucker-Smith are leading the development of **UDL Guidelines 3.0**, which introduce several transformative updates:

- **Emphasize identity** as part of learner variability—recognizing _who_ the learner is, alongside the _why_ (engagement), _what_ (representation), and _how_ (action and expression) of learning.
- **Acknowledge bias**—individual, institutional, and systemic—as a real and persistent barrier to learning.
- **Highlight interdependence and collective learning** as essential educational values.
- **Shift from teacher-centered to learner-centered language** to reframe how we design for inclusion.

You can read more about these updates here: [UDL Guidelines 3.0](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/more/about-guidelines-3-0)

### Our Brain as an Interdependent Web

Your brain is constantly predicting what it’s going to see before it actually sees it. It’s an "interdependent web," processing _six layers of context_ at any given moment. This predictive efficiency is where biases begin.

Take the viral phenomenon of the **blue and black dress**: a new study suggests that our **internal body clocks** might be the key. Early risers, exposed more to natural light, tend to see the dress as **white and gold**, while night owls—who rely more on artificial light—see **black and blue**.

This is just one example of how **implicit, rapid, and unconscious biases** form. These biases are **learned**, not inherited, and they are often difficult to unlearn.

What’s fascinating is that **GPT models hallucinate** in much the same way—because they’re also engaging in prediction. Like our brains, they "guess" what comes next based on prior context.

### The Brain and Bias

Our **top-down biases** are often productive—they help us make quick decisions—but they’re not always accurate or just.

Some biases can be **distorting**, **inaccurate**, or even **harmful**. These snap judgments happen so quickly—often within **200 milliseconds**—that we don’t even realize they’re occurring. Our brains immediately categorize what’s "like me" and "not like me" before we’re fully conscious of what we’re seeing.

Here’s how different parts of the brain relate to bias:

- **Back of the brain (visual cortex)** – Biases in what we _see_
- **Middle of the brain (limbic system)** – Biases in what we _feel_ (adds emotional value)
- **Front of the brain (prefrontal cortex)** – Biases in what we _do_ (decision-making, planning)

This breakdown reminds me of the Pixar movie _Inside Out_—each part of our brain playing a distinct emotional and cognitive role.

### A Provocative Question

If we could eliminate emotion, would we also eliminate bias?

> "We would still recognize faces or skin tones different from our own—but we wouldn’t know how to evaluate them."

Emotion and cognition are deeply intertwined. Removing one may disrupt the delicate balance required for empathy, fairness, and learning itself.

## Reflection on UDL – Strategic Networks: The Action and Expression Principle

**Dysgraphia** is a learning difference that falls under the broader category of learning disabilities in the United States. Students with dysgraphia often experience difficulty with fine motor skills, such as holding a pen or pencil. As a result, their handwriting may appear messy, uneven, or hard to decipher. However, it's important to recognize that while their writing might look scrambled to others, many of these students can read their own writing fluently and understand their thoughts clearly. The challenge lies not in their intelligence or understanding, but in their ability to express those thoughts in a conventional written format.

**Key takeaway:** Focus on the _goals_ of learning, and remain _flexible_ with the _means_. Consider offering multiple options for students to participate, express themselves, and demonstrate their understanding. The same principle should be applied to assessments—_one size does not fit all_.

The **critical UDL principle** here is the importance of **providing options, offering choice, and enabling student agency**. By doing so, educators can honor the diverse ways students process, engage with, and express their learning.

### Personal Reflection

In the real world, particularly in under-resourced educational settings, schools and teachers often default to a _one-size-fits-all_ approach. This is especially true in large classrooms—like the public school I attended—where a single teacher may be responsible for 60 students at a time. In such environments, standardizing assignments and grading procedures becomes a practical necessity due to limited time and resources.

However, I strongly resonate with the idea that **text and books, while historically efficient tools for knowledge transfer, are not the only valid means of communication**—especially in today’s information era. We now have a rich array of modalities at our disposal: audio recordings, videos, animations, podcasts, and more. These media forms can often convey information just as effectively—sometimes even more engagingly—than traditional text.

Personally, I was a slow reader growing up, and I often felt disengaged when required to read lengthy texts. In contrast, I found joy and deep understanding in watching animations and movies. Given the choice, I would often prefer a visual medium over written text. This preference wasn’t due to a lack of ability or interest—but because I processed and connected with information more effectively that way.

### Final Thoughts

As educators and designers of learning experiences, we need to remember that the **goal of education is not uniformity in output, but meaningful engagement and comprehension**. UDL encourages us to shift from asking _“Can the student write an essay?”_ to _“How can this student best demonstrate their understanding?”_—and that shift in mindset can be transformative.

By embracing **multiple means of action and expression**, we foster more inclusive, equitable, and empowering learning environments where all students can thrive.

## Reflection on Learner-Centered Design: Top 10 UDL Tips for Designing Engaging Learning Environments

Link to [CAST Professional Learning’s Top Ten UDL Tips for Developing Learning Goals](https://www.cast.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cast-udltipsfordevelopinglearninggoals-20200920-a11y.pdf)

Below are the 10 tips and my reflection:

1. `Start with a clear goal.`  
   It's critical that learners know the intended goals of the learning experience. As simple as that sounds, many instructors neglect this basic aspect. Growing up in my own K–12 and higher education, many instructors, lecturers, or professors focused on teaching concepts and shared the learning objectives at the beginning of the semester—but never talked about them again. I think it's important for instructors to always remind students of the learning objectives for each class, why they are learning the material, and its importance. For adult learners, even if instructors don't make the goals clear, learners should have the agency to figure out what they are learning and set goals on their own, whether it's independent, remote, or collaborative teamwork. I really like this first tip because it's also applicable in work environments and team meetings. Whenever I host meetings, the first thing I do is make it clear what we are discussing and what the "definition of success" or the goal of the meeting is. Every team member should be able to describe the goal in their own words. Oftentimes, visualization is the most powerful way to make a goal clear.

2. `Share goals in multiple ways.`  
   Wow, this is super powerful! Reflecting on my own learning experience and professional work experience in startups, big tech companies, and as a computer science instructor, I realize I often don't offer learners different ways to understand the goals. I usually only shared the learning objectives in written format. In company settings, we typically share goals via written memos or in meetings, but rarely in multiple formats. This is an AHA moment for me. Now I know that offering different ways to express the same ideas can be a powerful method to ensure understanding.

3. `Frame goals with expert learning in mind.`  
   "Expert learning, in the context of education and personal development, refers to the ability to acquire, retain, and apply knowledge effectively. It involves understanding one's own learning strengths and weaknesses, using strategic approaches to overcome challenges, and taking ownership of the learning process. Expert learners are also characterized by being resourceful, knowledgeable, strategic, goal-directed, purposeful, and motivated."  
   This is exactly what I am striving for—I want to become an expert learner myself.

- **Behaviorism**: Learning by developing new behaviors (making them habitual)
- **Information Processing & Cognitive Psychology**: Learning by observing, categorizing, generalizing, storing, and remembering
- **Individual Constructivism**: Learning by adjusting current knowledge and mental frameworks to new knowledge
- **Social Constructivism & Situated Learning**: Learning by emulating others in the context of increasingly expert practice

4. `Separate the goal from the means.`  
   Yes, as long as the goal is clear, we can provide multiple means of engagement. We don't need to dictate how learners master the content. They should have agency, and as instructors, we should give them the freedom to pursue the approach that works best for them.

5. `Prepare your assessment with the goals in mind.`  
   This means eliminating elements that are not essential to the learning goals. My reflection on this is that teachers in K–12 often assign homework or exams (in STEM, we call them "Psets"), but the goal is not always to assess how well students learned a concept. Often in my experience, I completed a Pset already knowing the content; the goal then became to build muscle memory to perform better in quizzes and exams. I would prefer flexible assessment options—as long as learners can demonstrate mastery of the knowledge, that should be sufficient. I think the current exam format in China (where I grew up) is more about selection—it selects students who are good at information retrieval and patient enough to go through repetitive training to achieve mastery and fluency.

6. `Include opportunities for personal connections to the goals.`  
   Yes, once again, this is super important. Goals only make sense if learners can relate them to their own lives. If I had my own company, I would provide opportunities for my team to articulate their own personal goals and their interpretations of the company goals.

7. `Divide large goals into sub-goals or objectives.`  
   I love how this encourages celebrating milestones or reducing barriers along the way. This is true in life as well—often we're intimidated by our New Year's resolutions, but we should break them down into smaller, achievable steps and celebrate the milestones. In a company setting, each team should create its own milestones and long-term goals. I feel many UDL principles are also applicable in leadership contexts.

8. `Consider the process as well as the end product.`  
   The process of learning can be just as valuable as the result. I really like this point—YES! In society, people often only see the end result, not the process, and that's why the process is often undervalued. But if you think about it, there are only a few end-result moments in life, and most of our time is spent in the process. So, my takeaway here is to enjoy the process. "Mistakes are an opportunity for reflection about what it takes to achieve a goal." YES! This is VERY IMPORTANT to remember. It also aligns with the topic of self-compassion that I chose for this course.

9. `Provide models and examples.`  
   "Offering examples of what excellence looks like (or 'sounds like' or 'feels like') gives learners a clear model of what to work toward." Yes, this reminds me of an important life lesson—always know where you're heading and what excellence looks like. In learning, having examples of excellence helps learners understand what they are aiming for. And who doesn’t want to be excellent?

10. `Make time for reflection.`  
    "We’re busy. Whether we are working asynchronously online or together in the same learning space, there is always a lot of curricular ground to cover. It is important to pause and encourage time for learners to reflect on how the goals and design of the experiences supported — or did not support — their learning and goals."  
    I found this to be very true as a life lesson. Too often, we are too busy to pause and reflect. This reinforces my decision to build a reflection tool!
