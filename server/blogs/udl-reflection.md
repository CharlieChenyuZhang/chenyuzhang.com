## Thoughts on UDL

After learning about the development of UDL, I really appreciate its iterative and expanding nature. UDL was initially created in a hospital setting to support students with disabilities that hindered their learning in traditional schools. Over time, its mission broadened to reducing barriers in traditional education, eventually moving beyond the hospital setting altogether.

I find the UDL framework particularly compelling because it focuses on fostering _expert learners_ [[1]](/blog/udl-reflection.md#reference-rose-2013) rather than simply having students memorize basic facts through rote learning. UDL-based learning goals emphasize both _learning_ and _doing_. However, in my experience, teachers are often too busy to thoughtfully design these authentic learning goals and tailor them to individual students—especially in the U.S., where classrooms are highly diverse, not just in learning needs but also in cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. This highlights a limitation of the UDL framework: it primarily addresses _ability_ but does not explicitly consider _identity_.

This raises an important question: Should it ultimately be the student's responsibility to make sense of the course content and develop the agency to understand _why_ they are learning it? Perhaps students shouldn’t be forced to study subjects if they don’t see their relevance.

One aspect of UDL I particularly admire is its commitment to continual improvement. I am especially interested in how learning technologies—particularly adaptive learning systems—can not only _teach_ but also _learn_ about each student’s unique strengths and weaknesses, then dynamically adjust to optimize their learning path. With this approach, the curriculum evolves in real-time, analyzing what works and what doesn’t for each student, and offering alternatives, as UDL suggests. Beyond individualization, the curriculum should also adapt to its broader cultural context—incorporating different values, knowledge, and skill sets. In essence, the curriculum itself should _both teach and learn_. This concept was also highlighted by David Rose in the Week 2 mini-lecture and discussed in a well-researched UDL paper [[2]](/blog/udl-reflection.md#reference-Rao-2023).

The UDL framework is grounded in three key brain networks [[3]](/blog/udl-reflection.md#reference-meyer-2014):

- **The affective network** – responsible for emotional processing and engagement.
- **The recognition network** – responsible for perception and pattern recognition.
- **The strategic network** – responsible for planning, motor skills, and executive functioning.

Ancient Chinese wisdom aligns closely with these ideas. Confucius once said _"有教无类"_ (_yǒu jiào wú lèi_), which translates to _"education for all, without discrimination."_ This is conceptually similar to the idea of equity in the Western world—the belief that everyone has a right to education. As an educator, I strongly believe that _there are no bad students—only ineffective teaching methods_. Confucius also advocated _"因材施教"_ (_yīn cái shī jiào_), meaning _"teaching according to individual abilities and needs."_ Remarkably, these ideas were established over 2,500 years ago.

One of my favorite discussions on this topic is Todd Rose’s TEDx Talk, _"The Myth of Average: Todd Rose at TEDxSonomaCounty."_ In this talk, Prof. Rose argues for the need to _“ban the average”_ and instead design for _the edges_—creating learning experiences that accommodate the widest possible range of students. This principle is at the heart of UDL, which rejects the outdated concept of an _“average learner.”_ However, a few key questions remain:

- How can this be achieved in a _cost-effective_ manner?
- How far should the design for the _edges_ extend? What defines a _reasonable range_ of inclusivity?

I also found this to be a useful handout on implementing UDL, developed by CAST (formerly known as the Center for Applied Special Technology):

Now, shifting our focus to the human brain: One fascinating concept I learned this week is the classification of species into _altricial_ and _precocial_ groups. Humans are an _altricial species_, meaning that when we are born, our brains are not fully developed—it takes us years to acquire basic skills like walking. In contrast, _precocial species_ (such as horses) can walk within hours of birth.

Another interesting concept is _neuronal migration_—the process by which neurons are formed and travel to the cortex (the outer layer of the brain). Initially, all neurons look identical as they migrate, but they _differentiate_ into specific types only once they reach their final destination.

## Reflection on UDL - Affective Networks: "Why of Learning"

Affect is related to people's feelings. Affective networks enable us to engage with tasks and influence our motivation to learn, setting up priorities and preferences. Affective states, such as stress and confidence, impact our ability to learn.

> While emotion and cognition can be somewhat separable, they’re rarely in opposition. Instead, they are intertwined in a collaborative relationship needed for normal function. As tasks with both emotive and cognitive components become more difficult (e.g., making an increasingly complex economic decision in a setting that is increasingly unfair), activity in the two structures becomes more synchronized.

From my own experience, when I am under stress, my cognitive ability tends to decrease, making it difficult to think. I can think better when I am calm. Not too long ago, I had an interview at my dream company, where the interviewer asked me to solve a coding question. I provided an answer, but the interviewer was not satisfied and asked me to come up with an alternative solution. At that moment, my mind went blank—I panicked. I felt my brain overheating, and I couldn't think of anything. As a result, I did not pass the interview.

Cognitive appraisal (or the Biopsychosocial Model of Challenge and Threat) can influence how we respond and perform in particular situations, both consciously and unconsciously.

This leads to the discussion of Growth Mindset versus Fixed Mindset.

A key consideration is how feedback can be provided in a way that does not trigger a threat response but instead fosters a growth mindset.

A notable insight from this paper is that the combination of **criticism, high standards, and assurance** is the secret ingredient to improving students' performance. This makes me wonder if an AI tutor could incorporate a similar approach to enhance students' learning outcomes.

I am interested in reading more about self-regulation—what it entails and what strategies people use to develop it.
