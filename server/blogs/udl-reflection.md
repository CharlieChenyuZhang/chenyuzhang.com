After learning about the development of UDL, I really appreciate its iterative and expanding nature. UDL was initially created in a hospital setting to support students with disabilities that hindered their learning in traditional schools. Over time, its mission broadened to reducing barriers in traditional education, eventually moving beyond the hospital setting altogether.

I find the UDL framework particularly compelling because it focuses on fostering _expert learners_ [[1]](/blog/udl-reflection.md#reference-rose-2013) rather than simply having students memorize basic facts through rote learning. UDL-based learning goals emphasize both _learning_ and _doing_. However, in my experience, teachers are often too busy to thoughtfully design these authentic learning goals and tailor them to individual students—especially in the U.S., where classrooms are highly diverse, not just in learning needs but also in cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. This highlights a limitation of the UDL framework: it primarily addresses _ability_ but does not explicitly consider _identity_.

This raises an important question: Should it ultimately be the student's responsibility to make sense of the course content and develop the agency to understand _why_ they are learning it? Perhaps students shouldn’t be forced to study subjects if they don’t see their relevance.

One aspect of UDL I particularly admire is its commitment to continual improvement. I am especially interested in how learning technologies—particularly adaptive learning systems—can not only _teach_ but also _learn_ about each student’s unique strengths and weaknesses, then dynamically adjust to optimize their learning path. With this approach, the curriculum evolves in real-time, analyzing what works and what doesn’t for each student, and offering alternatives, as UDL suggests. Beyond individualization, the curriculum should also adapt to its broader cultural context—incorporating different values, knowledge, and skill sets. In essence, the curriculum itself should _both teach and learn_. This concept was also highlighted by David Rose in the Week 2 mini-lecture and discussed in a well-researched UDL paper [[2]](/blog/udl-reflection.md#reference-Rao-2023).

The UDL framework is grounded in three key brain networks [[3]](/blog/udl-reflection.md#reference-meyer-2014):

- **The affective network** – responsible for emotional processing and engagement.
- **The recognition network** – responsible for perception and pattern recognition.
- **The strategic network** – responsible for planning, motor skills, and executive functioning.

Ancient Chinese wisdom aligns closely with these ideas. Confucius once said _"有教无类"_ (_yǒu jiào wú lèi_), which translates to _"education for all, without discrimination."_ This is conceptually similar to the idea of equity in the Western world—the belief that everyone has a right to education. As an educator, I strongly believe that _there are no bad students—only ineffective teaching methods_. Confucius also advocated _"因材施教"_ (_yīn cái shī jiào_), meaning _"teaching according to individual abilities and needs."_ Remarkably, these ideas were established over 2,500 years ago.

One of my favorite discussions on this topic is Todd Rose’s TEDx Talk, _"The Myth of Average: Todd Rose at TEDxSonomaCounty."_ In this talk, Prof. Rose argues for the need to _“ban the average”_ and instead design for _the edges_—creating learning experiences that accommodate the widest possible range of students. This principle is at the heart of UDL, which rejects the outdated concept of an _“average learner.”_ However, a few key questions remain:

- How can this be achieved in a _cost-effective_ manner?
- How far should the design for the _edges_ extend? What defines a _reasonable range_ of inclusivity?

I also found this to be a useful handout on implementing UDL, developed by CAST (formerly known as the Center for Applied Special Technology):

Now, shifting our focus to the human brain: One fascinating concept I learned this week is the classification of species into _altricial_ and _precocial_ groups. Humans are an _altricial species_, meaning that when we are born, our brains are not fully developed—it takes us years to acquire basic skills like walking. In contrast, _precocial species_ (such as horses) can walk within hours of birth.

Another interesting concept is _neuronal migration_—the process by which neurons are formed and travel to the cortex (the outer layer of the brain). Initially, all neurons look identical as they migrate, but they _differentiate_ into specific types only once they reach their final destination.

## Reflection on UDL - Affective Networks: "Why of Learning"

Affect is related to people's feelings. Affective networks enable us to engage with tasks and influence our motivation to learn, setting up priorities and preferences. Affective states, such as stress and confidence, impact our ability to learn.

> While emotion and cognition can be somewhat separable, they’re rarely in opposition. Instead, they are intertwined in a collaborative relationship needed for normal function. As tasks with both emotive and cognitive components become more difficult (e.g., making an increasingly complex economic decision in a setting that is increasingly unfair), activity in the two structures becomes more synchronized.

From my own experience, when I am under stress, my cognitive ability tends to decrease, making it difficult to think. I can think better when I am calm. Not too long ago, I had an interview at my dream company, where the interviewer asked me to solve a coding question. I provided an answer, but the interviewer was not satisfied and asked me to come up with an alternative solution. At that moment, my mind went blank—I panicked. I felt my brain overheating, and I couldn't think of anything. As a result, I did not pass the interview.

Cognitive appraisal (or the Biopsychosocial Model of Challenge and Threat) can influence how we respond and perform in particular situations, both consciously and unconsciously.

(Source: [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Biopsychosocial-Model-of-Challenge-and-Threat-and-Implications-for-Creativity_fig1_327947564))

This leads to the discussion of Growth Mindset versus Fixed Mindset.

A key consideration is how feedback can be provided in a way that does not trigger a threat response but instead fosters a growth mindset.

A notable insight from this paper is that the combination of **criticism, high standards, and assurance** is the secret ingredient to improving students' performance. This makes me wonder if an AI tutor could incorporate a similar approach to enhance students' learning outcomes.

There are a few pending questions.

- What does self-regulation entails and what strategies people use to develp it?
- How can AI be used to promote self-regulation?

## Reflection on UDL - The Recognition Network

The recognition network is located in the back of the brain. I found this article [[4]](/blog/udl-reflection.md#meditation24-7) interesting, where it talked about Aristotle (384-322 BC), who is credited with first numbering the senses in his work _De Anima_. Those senses are sight (vision), hearing (audition), smell (olfaction), taste (gustation), and touch (tactition). Because there is some overlap between different senses, different methods of neurological classification can yield as many as 21 senses. Eco-psychologist Michael J. Cohen puts the number of senses at our disposal at 53.

If we look at UDL horizontally, it is all about multi-modality.

- **Row 1: Access** - Providing multiple ways for students to access and interact with the content.
- **Row 2: Support** - Establishing connections, working with others, getting feedback, and responding in multiple ways.
- **Row 3: Executive Function** - Understanding what makes sense to us as individuals, how we connect it to other things we know, and how we set goals.

Besides this, today I also learned that alt tags for images are used by screen readers. As a software engineer, I know I need to add alt text, but I think it serves two purposes.

1. The alt text is displayed when the image link is broken and the image cannot be displayed.
2. Screen readers primarily read the alt text of the image to visually impaired users.

One misconception I had before was that screen readers relied on the `aria-label`, but after looking it up, I found that screen readers mainly use the `alt` text for images. In class, the instructor showed that _The New York Times_ and many other websites actually didn’t add alt text for images as of February 28, 2025, when I wrote this reflection.

My personal opinion is that ideally, all images should have alt text. However, some images on news websites do not carry any informational value and are meant purely for visual aesthetics. In such cases, there may be no need to add alt text, as the primary and secondary headlines on the news already convey enough information. But in an ideal scenario, all images should have alt text.

I also realized that many of the images on my personal website do not have alt text. Maybe I should start adding them going forward. What’s the point of learning UDL if my own website is not very user-friendly?

### The Myth of Learning Styles and Brain Plasticity

One surprising thing I learned this week is the so-called **myth of learning styles**. The concept of learning styles has been around for a few decades and is deceptively attractive—people like to believe they are visual learners or auditory learners. However, **people don’t actually learn that way!** This is an oversimplification of how our brains truly function.

**Recognition is variable.** Allison Posey mentioned **brain plasticity** and the concept of _live wiring_ or _live-wired_ from David Eagleman. The brain is an enormous system designed to extract patterns and meaning from those patterns. Connections are constantly forming—some fast, some slow, some strong, some weak—all happening simultaneously.

This reminds me of a paper by Xander Davies [[5]](/blog/udl-reflection.md#grokking-and-double-descent) discussing **Grokking and Double Descent**, as well as the interplay of slow and fast learning patterns. It’s fascinating to consider the balance between _live wiring_—the brain’s ongoing adaptability—and _hardwired_ connections that allow for rapid access to information.

### The Brain as a Prediction Machine

One of the most interesting insights is that our brains **are not passive recipients of information**. Instead, we are constantly and persistently **anticipating and predicting** what we will see and hear.

This realization could be a key innovation in **AI-driven tutoring systems**—if we can design AI models that anticipate and predict patterns like the human brain, we may be able to create more adaptive and effective learning experiences. Our **expectations** actively shape our perception, which has profound implications for AI tutors, multi-agent collaboration, and reinforcement learning models.

### Heterarchy vs. Hierarchy

- In a **heterarchy**, all nodes function in parallel, with no predefined importance.
- In a **hierarchy**, some nodes are prioritized over others.

Understanding the **balance between top-down and bottom-up processes** is crucial. A well-functioning **recognition network** takes advantage of both approaches. Teaching that relies solely on either top-down or bottom-up instruction **does not align with how our brains learn**.

### The Hidden Layers of Reading

Another key insight I gained is the **hidden layer of reading**—for example, when we see the word **MAT**, our brain does far more than just recognize the letters. We instinctively interpret meaning, context, and associations, all in a fraction of a second.

These insights are incredibly valuable as my brain makes connections between **how human cognition works and how machine learning models**—or **multi-agent collaboration systems**—could be designed in the future.
