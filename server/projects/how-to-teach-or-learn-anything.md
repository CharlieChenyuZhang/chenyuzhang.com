## Motivation

During a conversation with Dr. Tina Grotzer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, I shared my interest in using reinforcement learning algorithms to tailor content to each student’s needs. Dr. Grotzer raised an important point: while customization is valuable, what happens when students encounter content that cannot be personalized? This insight led me to reflect on the importance of student agency—their ability to take ownership of their learning. This project is motivated by the desire to explore theories and strategies that empower students to develop the skills and confidence to learn (almost) anything (independently).

In addition to focusing on student agency, this project aims to provide teachers with a variety of teaching principles and resources to help them facilitate learning (almost) anything for their students. This is an ongoing initiative, and more content will be added over time.
