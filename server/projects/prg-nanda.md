## Project Overview

NANDA (Networked Agents and Decentralized AI) is an initiative led by MIT Professor Ramesh Raskar that explores two major AI paradigms: Agentic AI and Decentralized AI. Agentic AI operates within trusted, controlled environments (like intranets), enhancing productivity through smart, proactive agents. In contrast, Decentralized AI functions in open, trustless networks (like the internet), empowering diverse AI agents to collaborate across sectors while ensuring privacy, verifiability, and local ownership of data. NANDA emphasizes the power of networked intelligence—agents becoming "smarter together"—and advocates for a future where individuals manage dozens of personal AI agents via no-code tools, becoming the "AIr traffic controllers" of their digital lives. The project aims to decentralize data, computation, and governance to create a more equitable and innovative AI ecosystem.

## Acknowledgements and My Contributions

This project is part of my research at the MIT Media Lab's Camera Culture Group, where I collaborate with faculty and researchers on the NANDA (Networked Agents and Decentralized AI) initiative. My contributions focus on developing open-source tools that enable individuals to configure, deploy, and manage their own AI agents, with the goal of fostering collaborative intelligence.
