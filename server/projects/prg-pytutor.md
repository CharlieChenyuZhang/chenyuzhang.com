## Project Overview

The project focuses on leveraging generative AI technologies to create **equitable computing education pathways**, particularly for under-resourced students at **minority-serving institutions (MSIs)** and **community colleges**.

---

## Research Goals

1. **Address educational disparities**

   - Provide **personalized AI-driven tutoring** for under-resourced students.
   - Help students balance school and work commitments with **round-the-clock support**.

2. **Evaluate LLM tutor effectiveness**

   - Assess how AI tutors impact **student retention** in introductory computing courses.
   - Develop AI strategies to **reduce attrition rates**.

3. **Advance AI for equitable learning**

   - Personalize AI-generated content to **respect students' cultural backgrounds**.
   - Ensure **inclusive and supportive** educational environments.

4. **Prioritize student and educator needs**

   - Design **AI tutors that enhance critical thinking** and problem-solving.
   - Equip students for the **collaborative work environments of the future**.
