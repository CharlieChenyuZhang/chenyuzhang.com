            Public speaking was never my strong suit. As a child, I struggled
            with stuttering, at one point even trying to speak with stones in my
            mouth. When I moved to Canada at 18, I worried people would judge my
            accent. Over time, I realized that what I say matters more than how
            I sound. Iâ€™ve also carried the weight of being bullied in high
            school, a story I only recently gained the courage to share. By
            opening up, I hope to encourage others to do the same. Storytelling
            is for everyone, and every voice deserves to be heard.
